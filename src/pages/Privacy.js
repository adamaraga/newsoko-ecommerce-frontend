          The email address you provide for order processing, will only be used

        <p>
          <b>How do we protect your information?</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of
          your personal information when you place an order or access your
          personal information.
        </p>
        <p>
          We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit
          information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology
          and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to
          be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such
          systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.
        </p>

          After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social
          security numbers, financials, etc.) will not be stored on our servers.

        <p>
          <b>Do we use cookies?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider
          transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if
          you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to
          recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your
          shopping cart and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site
          interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in
          the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to
          assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service
          providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our
          behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you prefer, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time
          a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies via
          your browser settings. Like most websites, if you turn your cookies
          off, some of our services may not function properly. However, you can
          still place orders over the telephone or by contacting customer
          service.

          <b>Do we disclose any information to outside parties?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your
          personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted
          third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our
          business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep
          this information confidential. We may also release your information
          when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce
          our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or
          safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may
          be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other
